            <b>In Short:</b> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies
            to collect and store your information.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web
            beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific
            information about how we use such technologies and how you can
            refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.
          </p>
          <h3>5. How long do we keep your information?</h3>
          <p>
            In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to
            fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
            otherwise required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).
          </p>
          <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
            information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
            any further processing until deletion is possible.
          </p>
          <h3>6. How do we keep your information safe?</h3>
          <p>
            <b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through
            a system of organizational and technical security measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
            organizational security measures designed to protect the security of
            any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards
            and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
            over the Internet or information storage technology can be
            guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that
            hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will
            not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
            steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
            protect your personal information, transmission of personal
            information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should
            only access the Services within a secure environment

            measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you
            become aware of any data we may have collected from children under

            reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

          <h3>9. Controls for do-not-track features</h3>
          <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track &dout;DNT&duot; feature or
            setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
            have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
            collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
            recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
            such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
            other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
            be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
            we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
            in a revised version of this privacy notice.

            date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is

            changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you
